    <p>As expected, we can see that the tempreature gets warmer as we near the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). We can also see that the southern hemisphere is warmer than the northern hemisphere this time of year. This is likely due to the tilt of the earth and the season in which the data was collected.</p>
